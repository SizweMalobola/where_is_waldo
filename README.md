# Where Is Waldo 

This project is a web version of a british series of puzzle books called [Where is Wally?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Wally%3F)

## How it works

The player first chooses a photo before the game begins. After the photo has been chosen a timer begins counting up. The player is supposed to look for Waldo, Odlaw and the Wizard, all of which are hiding in plain sight somewhere on the chosen photo. The goal of this game is to find Waldo and his associates as quickly as possible to earn top rank on the leaderboard. Once Waldo and his associates have been found the time the player took to finish the round will be displayed and the player will be prompted to fill in their name which will be displayed on the leaderboard. 

+ There are four photo puzzles to choose from, each with their own leaderboards.
+ On each photo puzzle you have to find 3 characters(Waldo,Odlaw,Wizard).
